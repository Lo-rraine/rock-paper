# Rock Paper Scissors ðŸŽ®
This is my take of the classic [rock-paper-scissors game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors). I developed this project using javascript because it is one of the top in webdev and I cannot be left behind. If you are trying to understand concepts and logic as a newbie in javascript then you should clone this project.

## install the project
To get the game up and running ensure that node.js is installed and on an empty folder
Open your terminal (git bash) and run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/Lo-rraine/rock-paper.git
cd rock-paper
npm serve i
serve 
```
You should see a serving press on the link and your rock-paper-scissors game will run locally.
Have fun ðŸ˜„
